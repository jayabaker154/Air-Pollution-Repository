# Air Pollution Analysis

### Project Overview

In this project, I've used Python programing language and Anaconda to prepare, analyze, and visualize the air pollution dataset. I've uncovered valuable insights and created visualizations that shed light on the global air pollution patterns.

### Data Sources
Air Pollution Data: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the “Air Pollution” dataset containing a combination of world pollution data.

### Tools
- Python Programming Langauge
- Anaconda Cloud- Data Cleansing and Exploratory Analysis
### Data Preparation
- Data loading and inspection.
- Data transformation and cleansing.
### Exploratory Data Analysis
- Exploration to identify trends and patterns in the dataset.
- Answer the following questions to gain insight about air pollution deaths dataset:
    - Which air pollutant was most fatal?
    - Which countries had the highest total deaths by air pollution?
    - Which countries had the lowest total deaths by air pollution?
    - How has total deaths by air pollution in America changed overtime?
    - How were different regions of the world affected by air pollution deaths by overtime?
### Conclusion
Air pollution has been a serious problem for many years and has resulted in many deaths. Through this exploratory data analysis, I found that third world countries located in Africa and Asia were most affected by air pollution deaths between 1990 and 2017. Developed countires in the West were the least affected by deaths caused by air pollution and America experienced a downward trend in deaths caused by air pollution overtime.
